## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A virtual environment tool (`venv` or `virtualenv`)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sre-challenge-repo.git
   cd sre-challenge-repo
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
